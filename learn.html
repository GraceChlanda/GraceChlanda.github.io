        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of misconceptions about Service Dog laws due to a
          large number of online scams.<strong>
            The Department of Justice (DOJ), the Americans with Disabilities Act
            (ADA), and the Housing and Urban Development act (HUD),</strong
          >
          work together to outline the laws for Service Dogs (SDs) and their
          handlers. These laws allow a SD to accompany a disabled individual
          into public domains with the understanding that the SD is trained to
          preform a task that mitigates the handler's disability.
          <br /><br />Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) are different than SDs
          because they require a prescription and don't need training. While SDs
          need to be specifically trained, the law doesn't require that they be
          professionally trained. This is largely due to the lack of regulation
          in the dog training industry. Because of this, if a dog can preform
          their mitigating task, is bathroom trained, doesn't bark more than
          once, and is under control, then they qualify as an SD. <br /><br />To
          qualify as a SD handler, one must have a disability. The ADA defines
          this disability separately from Social Security. The ADA considers any
          record of an impairment that substantially limits a major life
          activity to be a disability. Handlers don't need to disclose their
          disability to anyone except, doctors, businesses they are requesting
          work accommodations from, and landlords. <br /><br />
          Similarly, there is no SD registry and SDs don't need to wear anything
          to identify them. Businesses can protect themselves from frauds by
          asking if the dog is a service dog and which tasks their dog preforms
          to help it. Housing and workplaces can go beyond this by requiring
          medical proof of disability and assessing the need for reasonable
          accommodation.

      <div class="training-principles-overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          To be a successful dog trainer, there are some concepts that need
            to be understood. These include Classical Conditioning, Operant
            Conditioning, Counter Conditioning, the Premack Principle, Chaining
            Behaviors, Lumping, Primary vs. Secondary Reinforcers,
            Generalization, Shaping, Extinction, Behavior Modification, Behavior
            Management, Positive Interrupters, and Schedules of Reinforcement.
            <br /><br />
            All of these concepts are already built into common training
            practices. Understanding these, however, will give you a better idea
            of how to personalize your training plan to your specific dog. The
            summary of all of these concepts, is that you must ask your dog to
            do simple things in a <strong>variety</strong> of circumstances
            while <strong>rewarding</strong> the behavior you want to see. If
            your dog is having a hard time learning, it is likely because of one
            of these three things:
            <ul>
              <li>
                you're asking something <strong><i>too complex </i></strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                the environment is<strong><i> overwhelming</strong></i>
              </li>
              <li>
                the reinforcer is not <strong><i>strong, Immediate, </strong></i> or<strong><i> consistent </strong></i>enough
              </li>
            </ul>

          Socialization
        </h3>
        <p>
          To understand foundational training, you need to look at the developmental stages of a dog. For example, puppies don't gain control of their bladder until around 12-16 weeks, so trying to potty train them earlier than that would be counterproductive.<br><br> One of the most important parts of service dog training is socialization. This starts from birth all the way up until the age of 16 weeks. <i>You can still do socialization training after this, but it will be harder.</i> For this training, the goal is to cultivate a calm and positive reaction from the dog to their environment. This allows your service dog in training (SDIT) to focus on working instead of being too excited or fearful. <br><br>It's important to socialize your SDIT to things like elevators, bikes, wheelchairs, store displays, loudspeakers, and children through conditioning and counterconditioning. There are many places online with example socialization lists such as this one:

        <h3>What to Train and When?</h3>
        <p>
          While you do want to make sure your SDIT is comfortable with everything, it’s important not to overwork them. Puppies reach Adolescence at 5 to 6 months, and it continues until they are 18 to 24 months old. During this time their attention spans shrink, and they often get frustrated easily due to their hormones. So, it is best to take it easy during this time and keep things fun so that your SDIT is still motivated to work for you. <br><br> So how much should you train? Based on personal experience and the advice of other SD trainers, puppies learn best in 10-minute sessions 2 times a day. Adolescents learn best in 5-minute sessions 3 or 4 times a day. Adults learn best in 15-minute sessions 1 to 2 times a day.

          How to Choose Your Tasks
        </h2>
        <p>
          Task training is the very last thing that needs to be trained, and it’s what takes your dog from being a well-trained pet to a service dog.<br><br> The disability you have will determine the task that your dog will do to help mitigate your disability. For example, I have flashbacks and intrusive thoughts that trigger vocal and physical tics. So, one of the tasks my SD is trained to do is provide tactile stimulation by jumping on me and scratching me when she notices this happening. By doing this she helps distract me from my thoughts so that I can refocus on whatever it was that I was doing. <br><br>Some other example tasks include providing something to brace against for people with balance and mobility issues; retrieving things the handler cannot; checking things for allergens; smelling changes in blood glucose; leading a handler away from unsafe situations; and alerting a handler to changes in heart rate. <br><br> Once you get to this part of your training you should be able to use all the training principles and foundations to train whichever behavior you will help you.
