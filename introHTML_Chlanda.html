    Hello everyone. I'm Grace Chlanda. I am a twenty two year old Digital Storytelling major. I hope to do specialize in rigging, which is creating the skeleton for 3D animated models to move. I find it challenging and fulfilling, yet others seem to think I have a natural aptitude for it. I have played around a little with HTML and CSS because my brother recently decided he wants to code as a career. However, I haven't learned much past some basic tags. I want to learn how to make my own portfolio website in the future. Additionally, I think learning about code may help me manipulate Autodesk Maya so that I can troubleshoot it's functionality flaws. There are also some cool animation function presets that people have made out of code. Despite enjoying computers, in my free time I like reading fiction, horseback riding, dog training, and target archery.
