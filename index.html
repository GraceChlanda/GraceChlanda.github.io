                    When I tried to look information about if I qualified for a service dog or not, or even how to go about getting one, I was met with a bunch of scam websites. These websites asked for money to register one’s pet as a service dog. However, there are no legal Service Dog Registries in the United States. Additionally, these websites mislead people about the legally covered definition of both “disability” and “service dog”. These kinds of websites keep people from getting the help they need. In contrast, I want to give information to people with disabilities who wish to train their own service dogs. Doing this can have many benefits including, lowering the workload of official programs, creating a stronger working relationship with one’s dog, personalizing trained tasks, and sometimes saving money. This website covers the basics for service dog laws, dog training concepts, foundational dog training, and task training. Furthermore, there are resources placed throughout this site for more information.
