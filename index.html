            Hello everyone! Hopefully this website helps you navigate your

        <h3>Why I Made This Site</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          When I tried to look information about if I qualified for a service
          dog or not, or even how to go about getting one, I was met with a
          bunch of scam websites. These websites asked for money to register
          one’s pet as a service dog. However, there are no legal Service Dog
          Registries in the United States. Additionally, these websites mislead
          people about the legally covered definition of both “disability” and
          “service dog”. These kinds of websites keep people from getting the
          help they need. In contrast, I want to give information to people with
          disabilities who wish to train their own service dogs. Doing this can
          have many benefits including, lowering the workload of official
          programs, creating a stronger working relationship with one’s dog,
          personalizing trained tasks, and sometimes saving money. This website
          covers the basics for service dog laws, dog training concepts,
          foundational dog training, and task training. Furthermore, there are
          resources placed throughout this site for more information.
