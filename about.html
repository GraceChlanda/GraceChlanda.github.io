          I am a twenty-two-year-old, disabled, college student. My sophomore
          year I was having some problems doing majojr life activities. So, I
          adopted my dog Josephine (Jojo) to be an Emotional Support Animal.
          Then, I spent another two years training her to be my service dog.
          <br />
          My family has always owned dogs growing up. Additionally, I have spent
          a lot of time working at a dog kennel and a professional dog walker.
          When I adopted Jojo, I spent hours a day for months learning about
          service dog training, and holding to the adage:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          &#34;There are <b>no</b> <i>stubborn</i> dogs.&#34; <br />
          <em>&#8208;Donna Hill</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I learned from hundreds of online videos as well as forums. I also had
          the opportunity to take several college courses on the principles of
          learning as well as several professional training seminars. Recently,
          I have been able to work aside several local service dog trainers.<br />
          With these experiences me and my dog became a successful team. In the
          meantime, I lead a <i>Facebook</i> group for service dog handlers in
          Columbia, Missouri where we offer training help to anyone who needs
          it.
