        <div class="about-paragraph">
          <p>
            I am a twenty-two-year-old, disabled, college student. My sophomore
            year I was having some problems doing majojr life activities. So, I
            adopted my dog Josephine (Jojo) to be an Emotional Support Animal.
            Then, I spent another two years training her to be my service dog.
            <br />
            My family has always owned dogs growing up. Additionally, I have
            spent a lot of time working at a dog kennel and a professional dog
            walker. When I adopted Jojo, I spent hours a day for months learning
            about service dog training, and holding to the adage:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            &#34;There are <b>no</b> <i>stubborn</i> dogs.&#34; <br />
            <em>&#8208;Donna Hill</em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I learned from hundreds of online videos as well as forums. I also
            had the opportunity to take several college courses on the
            principles of learning as well as several professional training
            seminars. Recently, I have been able to work aside several local
            service dog trainers.<br />
            With these experiences me and my dog became a successful team. In
            the meantime, I lead a <i>Facebook</i> group for service dog
            handlers in Columbia, Missouri where we offer training help to
            anyone who needs it.
