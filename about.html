    This is my Service Dog Journey
    </h3>
        <p>
        I am a twenty-two-year-old, disabled, college student. My sophomore year I was having some problems doing majojr life activities. So, I adopted my dog Josephine (Jojo) to be an Emotional Support Animal. Then, I spent another two years training her to be my service dog. <br> 
        My family has always owned dogs growing up. Additionally, I have spent a lot of time working at a dog kennel and a professional dog walker. When I adopted Jojo, I spent hours a day for months learning about service dog training, and holding to the adage:
            <blockquote>
            “There are <b>no</b> <i>stubborn</i> dogs.”
            </blockquote>
        I learned from hundreds of online videos as well as forums. I also had the opportunity to take several college courses on the principles of learning as well as several professional training seminars. Recently, I have been able to work aside several local service dog trainers.<br>
        With these experiences me and my dog became a successful team. In the meantime, I lead a <i>Facebook</i> group for service dog handlers in Columbia, Missouri where we offer training help to anyone who needs it.
